# Upgrade `helm schema` from v2.1 to v2.2

Upgrading from any v2.1.x version to v2.2.0.

## Logs

Logs and errors are now printed to STDERR instead of STDOUT.
This is because we introduced support for `-o -` to mean
"write output to STDOUT", so logs were moved to STDERR.

This allows you to pipe the result from `helm schema` more easily:

```bash
helm schema -o - | jq .properties
```

If you were previously capturing the logs from `helm schema` in a script,
then you need to update your scripts. Such as:

```diff
diff script.sh (bash/zsh)
- HELM_SCHEMA_OUTPUT="$(helm schema)"
+ HELM_SCHEMA_OUTPUT="$(helm schema 2>&1)"
```

```diff
diff script.fish (fish)
- set HELM_SCHEMA_OUTPUT $(helm schema)
+ set HELM_SCHEMA_OUTPUT $(helm schema 2>&1)
```

```diff
diff script.ps1 (powershell)
- $HELM_SCHEMA_OUTPUT = helm schema
+ $HELM_SCHEMA_OUTPUT = helm schema 2>&1
```
