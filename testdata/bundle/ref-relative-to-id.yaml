# Tries to replicate issue https://github.com/losisin/helm-values-schema-json/issues/210

# What's going on here is that the $ref below targets a section of "ref-relative-to-id.json"
# that uses an $id, and so the "foo: 1"'s $ref should be updated to be relative
# to that $id instead of relative to the root schema.

foo: 1 # @schema $ref: ./ref-relative-to-id.json#/definitions/bar/items
